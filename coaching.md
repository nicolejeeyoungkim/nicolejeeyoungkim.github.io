title: Career/Internship Coaching
subtitle: 대학교/커리어 상담

I offer virtual & in-person coaching for highschool/post secondary students for a variety of topics, including:
- Post-Secondary major selection/application
- Guidance for students who have no idea what they want to do after high school
- How to break into tech from a non-tech background
- How to get internships as a non-coop student
- How to get into data science

My backstory:
As a second generation Korean-Canadian immigrant, I have seen many other first and second generation immigrants fall into the trap of either:
- picking a STEM major because "I don't know what to do after high school, I am good at (X STEM subject), and surely any STEM major ensures that I will be able to get a job after I graduate right?"
- falling to the well-intentioned but misguided advice from parents of "In our home country, doctors, lawyers, engineers make good money and are well respected, so if you want to have a good life in Canada, you should be one of those."
Of course it's not their fault, usually the reason is because they don't have many elder family/family friends that have gone through the Canadian university and Canadian corporate experience themselves. Don't worry if you yourself don't have someone like that, that's why I'm here :blush:
I have firsthand experience of going through the Canadian/Ontario school curriculum, applying to UWaterloo Computer Science, getting rejected and going to UWaterloo Math (non-coop as well), consistently getting internships throughout my undergraduate and converting my last internship into a fulltime offer as a Data Scientist. Basically, I've learned all the lessons about university & internships/career development first hand, and I'm ready to share my knowledge with you so you don't have to learn the hard way.

If you think my experience is something you think would be useful to listen to, email me and we can set up a free consultation session to see how I can help you!
