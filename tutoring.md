We offer online/in-person tutoring for high school Mathematics and Computer Science. 
Additionally we offer tutoring for early level university Computer Science + Data Science/Statistics courses. This can either be with a course focus (ex: someone who needs help with a specific course/is looking to prepare to excel in this course) or a focus on learning how to code to prepare for internship/coop applications to increase the likelihood of employment.
