We offer online/in-person tutoring for high school Mathematics and Computer Science. 
Additionally we offer tutoring for early level university Computer Science + Data Science/Statistics courses. This can either be with a course focus (ex: someone who needs help with a specific course/is looking to prepare to excel in this course) or a focus on learning how to code to prepare for internship/coop applications to increase the likelihood of employment.

---------
Computer Science:
Learn coding from an actual current full-time [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigeltroy/) with over 2 years of internship experience! You'll learn the skills/concepts actually required to land & succeed at your internship/entry level software engineering job!
