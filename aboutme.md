Hello! My name is Nicole Kim. I'm currently a data scientist at Wealthsimple and I'm a recent grad from UWaterloo! (BMath in Computational Mathematics)

Outside of work, here are some of my interests:
- Baking, Cooking
- Video Games (Teamfight Tactics)


### Let's chat!

Feel free to email me/message me on Linkedin if you're down for a coffee chat! (if you're in Toronto)
